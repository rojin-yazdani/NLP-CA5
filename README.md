# Spam Detection and Sentiment Analysis using ELMo and BERT

## Introduction
This exercise was completed in preparation for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course at [Tehran University](https://ut.ac.ir/en) in 2020.

In this exercise, we are going to use contextual embedding method with pre-trained ELMo and Bert models for Spam Detection and Sentiment Analysis. We intends to use these pre-trained models for our tasks.

The image below shows how we can use BERT for Spam Detection task.
